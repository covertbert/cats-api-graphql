# üêà Cats GraphQL API

This is a cats API, which retrieves the cat data used to power the internet. It is a Node service, written in TypeScript, which uses Apollo Server to expose a GraphQL endpoint.

## Running locally

To get the service up and running quickly in a local environment you need to:

- Run `npm run all`
- Visit `http://localhost:4000` in the browser to interact with the API via the GraphQL playground once the Docker container are up and running.

### In development

To run in watch mode for development you'll need to:

- Spin up just the Postgres container in Docker with `npm run db`.
- Once the docker container is up and running, hit `npm run watch` from another tab in the root of the repo which will first run the migrations/seeds and then run the project in watch mode and serve it on `http://localhost:4000`

## Unit & integration tests

Because the integration tests rely on a database you need to first run Docker with `npm run db`. You can then run `npm run test` from the root of the repo once the db has spun up.

## CI Pipeline

There are 2 CI pipelines that run in GitHub Actions:

- Branch pipeline: Runs unit and integration tests, preventing PRs being merged without passing checks
- Master pipeline: Runs unit and integration tests again but then deploys if they are successful
